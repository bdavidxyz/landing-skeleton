## Design notes

Only one column is used, which is excellent for conversion. The drawback is that you have very few word to convince your user to subscribe.

Responsive is easy, each element stay on the middle of the screen.

This sample could be seen as extremely dry, you could replace the static image by a little animation, as instapaper does. But don't lost the customer's attention.

The title is bolder than the page it was inspired from, so it can still be improved.

We suggest that Call-To-Action should be with filled primary color, contrary to what instapaper did. The Call-To-Action should remain the most obvious thing of the section.

You can also reduce font-weight of the title, to make it more elegant.
